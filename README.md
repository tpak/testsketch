# testsketch
testsketch is my simple Arduino sketch that I use to test/verify new boards and versions of Arduino tools, etc and also the ability to listen on the serial port, which seems to always be a challenge with each new version of macOS/OSX.

You might also find other info here as I take notes to myself.
